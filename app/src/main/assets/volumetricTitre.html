            <div class="content">The analytical method wherein the concentration of a substance in a solution is estimated by adding exactly the same number
                of equivalents of another substance present in a solution of known concentration is called volumetric analysis.<br>This is the basic principle of

                    The estimated value of acid in a solution can be determined by adding a solution of standard base (or vice-versa). A suitable indicator
                    is added drop-by-drop to the solution whose concentration is to be estimated. This helps in detecting the equivalence point.<br><br>
                </div>
                <div>An acid-base indicator gives different colors of different compounds. An indicator is chosen in a particular titration
                    based on the pH-range of the indicator and the pH change near the equivalence point.<br><br>

                    <div>When HCI is added to the alkaline solution, alkali is neutralized. This results in the pH of the solution getting decreased.
                        The pH decreases initially at a rapid pace since the strong base (NaOH) is neutralized completely.
                        Whereas when Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is converted to NaHCO<sub>3</sub> completely, the solution remains
                        weakly basic. This is due to the presence of NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(which is weaker as compared to Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>).
                        It is at this point, where it is noticed that phenolphthalein changes color since it requires a weakly basic solution to show
                        the color change.<br><br></div>

                    <div class="content">When HCI is further added, the pH decreases even more and when all the NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>reacts to form NaCI,
                        CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O the solution becomes weakly acidic since
                        the formation of the weak acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) occurs. At this point, methyl orange changes color as it
                        requires a weakly acidic solution to show the color change.<br><br>

                    <p>In this equation the mole ratio of NaOH (base) and HCl (acid) is 1:1 as determined by the balanced chemical equation. The equivalence
                        point is where the moles of titrant and analyte in the reaction are equal.</p>

                    <p class="diffclr4"><span>M<sub>acid</sub> x V<sub>acid</sub>  =  M<sub>base</sub> x V<sub>base</sub></span></p>
                    <p>1.25	x  35  =  M<sub>base</sub>  x  25</p>
                    <p>43.75  =  M<sub>base</sub>  x  25</p>

                    <p><span>Answer:</span></p>
                    <p>In this equation the mole ratio of acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and base (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is 2:1. In this case a modified version
                        of the  M<sub>acid</sub> x V<sub>acid</sub>  =  M<sub>base</sub> x V<sub>base</sub> equation is required. </p>
                    <p>2 x M<sub>acid</sub> x V<sub>acid</sub>  =  M<sub>base</sub> x V<sub>base</sub></p>
                    <p>2 x  1.21  x  28.35  =  M<sub>base</sub>  x  35.24</p>
                    <p>68.61  =  M<sub>base</sub>  x  35.24</p>
                    <p>1.95  =  M<sub>base</sub></p>

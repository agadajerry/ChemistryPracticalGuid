        There are primarily two aspects of chemistry: theory and practical. The tutorials in this app is mainly concerned with the latter.

        Practical chemistry is divided into two parts, namely analysis and synthesis. Chemical analysis involves the determination of the composition of mixtures and compounds. It entails following strict procedures whereby the constituents of given mixtures or compounds can be determined correctly.

        Chemical synthesis is a process whereby two or more entirely different substances (reactants) combine under suitable conditions to form one or more entirely different substances (products) with different chemical properties. The text in this App     is however not concerned with chemical synthesis. Full attention is given to chemical analysis, which is subdivided into qualitative and quantitative analysis.

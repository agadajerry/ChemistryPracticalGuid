            The Flame test involves exposing the compound to a flame and identifying the compound by the flame color produced.
             When the compound is heated, the electrons move to energy levels that are higher.
             This movement makes the ions energetically unstable and they move back into the previous energy
            join. As they move back, the ions release light energy. On the type of ions, this light energy is
            different and produces different <u style = background-color:red;>colors of flame</u>. Below are some flame test of cations:

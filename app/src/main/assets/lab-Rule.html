            <h3>It's easy to contaminate the sample through poor laboratory technique, so it's important to adhere to certain rules:
            </h3>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>Do not use tap water. Rather, use distilled water or deionized water.
            </li>
            <li>Glassware must be clean prior to use. It's not essential that it be dried.
            </li>
            <li>Don't put a reagent dropper tip into the mouth of a test tube. Dispense reagent from above the test tube lip to avoid contamination.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix solutions by flicking the test tube. Never cover the test tube with a finger and shake the tube. Avoid exposing yourself to the sample.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps of Qualitative Analysis
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If the sample is presented as a solid (salt), it's important to note the shape and color of any crystals.</li>
            <li>Reagents are used to separate cations into groups of related elements.
            </li>
            <li>Ions in a group are separated from each other. After each separation stage, a test is performed to confirm certain ions truly were removed. The test is not performed on the original sample!
                Separations rely on different characteristics of ions. These may involve redox reactions to change oxidation state, differential solubility in an acid, base, or water, or precipitating certain ions.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <string name="qualitativeNanalysisBody">The aim of qualitative analysis is to determine the metallic radicals--- cations, and acidic radicals â€“ anions, present in an unknown substance. The methods of determining these can be stated as follows:\n
1. Preliminary investigation: the physical properties (e.g., appearance,
cations and acidic radicalsanions, present in an unknown substance.
smell, colour) of the substances are noted.\n
2. Identification of metallic radicals: this largely depends on the formation of coloured precipitates (with the exception of ammonia).\n
3. Identification of acidic radicals: this largely depends on the recognition of gases
